# RubixCube


This project contains the basis of a rubix cube class with the intention of being able to use it in other
projects later on, specifically a 3-d rendering project to be used as a object, and to also eventually
make a solver for the cube.

Otherwise, this can pretty widely be used in any type of project as it has all the necessary function for
rotating faces, turning the cube and painting the cube. This functions and the rubix cube class use
ideas of vectors and transformations to make the abstraction of the class easier to code.
